            "most popular choices for building async APIs in Python. It offers automatic OpenAPI "
            "documentation, type validation, and exceptional performance.\n\n"
            "2. **Django** (with async views) - Since Django 3.1+, the framework supports async "
            "views and middleware. While not natively async throughout, Django's ecosystem and "
            "maturity make it a strong contender.\n\n"
            "3. **Starlette** - The lightweight ASGI framework that FastAPI is built upon. "
            "Starlette is excellent for developers who want more control and less magic.\n\n"
            "4. **Flask** (with async support) - Flask 2.0+ added async view support, though "

            "developer experience, and automatic documentation generation makes it hard to beat "
            "for API development.\n\n"
            "**Django** has been adding async support progressively. If you need a full-featured "
            "web framework with ORM, admin panel, and auth built-in, Django with async views is "
            "worth considering.\n\n"

            "the most complete web framework. The async ORM improvements in Django 4.1+ have "
            "made it increasingly viable for async workloads.\n\n"
