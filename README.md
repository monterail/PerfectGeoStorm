**Developers increasingly discover software through AI** -- ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and others. When someone asks "what's the best library for X?", the AI's answer shapes adoption. But you have no idea what these models are saying about your project.

**GeoStorm fixes this.** It monitors multiple AI models on a schedule, tracks how they perceive and recommend your software, and alerts you when things change -- a new competitor appears, your ranking drops, or a model stops mentioning you entirely.

One container. One command. Full visibility into your AI presence.

## Quick Start

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name geostorm ghcr.io/geostorm-ai/geostorm
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) -- the demo loads immediately.

**That's it.** No git clone, no build step, no API keys, no database setup. A demo project with 90 days of synthetic monitoring data is ready to explore.

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- That's it. Everything else runs inside the container.

</details>

## What You'll See

The demo project ships with realistic sample data so you can explore every feature immediately:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Signal Panel** | A unified feed of alerts, ranked by severity and recency |
| **Alerts Feed** | Critical and warning signals with full context on what changed |
| **Perception Chart** | Track your recommendation share and positioning across models over time |

The demo data covers multiple AI models, competitor tracking, and trend analysis so you can see exactly how GeoStorm works before connecting your own projects.

---

## Next Steps

To start monitoring your own software:

**1. Get an API key** at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) -- one key gives you access to multiple AI models.

**2. Restart with your key:**

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -e OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-... --name geostorm ghcr.io/geostorm-ai/geostorm
```

**3. Create a project** in the UI and GeoStorm starts monitoring on a schedule.

## Alert Types

GeoStorm detects and alerts on these signals:

| Alert | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `competitor_emergence` | Critical | A new competitor has appeared in AI recommendations for your category |
| `disappearance` | Critical | Your software has stopped being mentioned by one or more AI models |
| `recommendation_share_drop` | Warning | Your share of AI recommendations has declined significantly |
| `position_degradation` | Warning | Your software is being listed lower in AI recommendation rankings |
| `model_divergence` | Warning | Different AI models are giving substantially different recommendations about your software |

---

## Architecture

GeoStorm runs as a single Docker container with no external dependencies:

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Backend** | FastAPI serving the REST API and running scheduled monitoring jobs via APScheduler (in-process) |
| **Frontend** | Astro with React islands, styled with TailwindCSS, charts powered by Recharts |
| **Database** | SQLite, stored in a mounted volume (`./data/`) |
| **Scheduling** | APScheduler runs inside the FastAPI process -- no separate worker, no Redis, no message queue |

The entire stack is self-contained. One container, one port, one volume mount.

---

## Configuration

GeoStorm works out of the box with zero configuration. For production use, you can optionally configure notification channels via environment variables in a `.env` file:

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Slack** | Set a webhook URL to receive alerts in a Slack channel |
| **Email** | Configure SMTP settings for email notifications |
| **Custom Webhook** | Point alerts at any HTTP endpoint |

All notification channels are optional. GeoStorm always displays alerts in the UI regardless of notification configuration.
